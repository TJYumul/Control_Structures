This repository contains simple Python programs that demonstrate the use of **control structures** and **basic data handling**. It is designed for beginners who are learning how to work with:

- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`)
- Data structures like `list`, `dictionary`, and `set`
- User input and output formatting
